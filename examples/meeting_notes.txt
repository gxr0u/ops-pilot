We discussed the Q3 launch timeline during the weekly sync.

Engineering mentioned that backend APIs are mostly complete, but the frontend
is behind schedule due to recent scope changes.

Decision was made to delay the Q3 launch by one week to ensure stability.

Aditya will follow up with the frontend team to reassess scope and timelines.

A key risk was identified around dependency on the external analytics vendor,
which could further impact the schedule.

Open question: Do we need to cut non-critical features to meet the revised deadline?
